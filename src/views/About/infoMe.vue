      <p class="mb-3">
        I started pursuing my career and hobbies seriously in <strong>2019</strong>, just before the pandemic.
        Receiving my first drawing tablet was a milestone — I was so happy to draw my favorite characters from shows,
        books, and games.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The pandemic brought challenges, especially boredom and moments of self-doubt, making me feel like my art wasn’t
        worth it.
        But I never completely gave up.
      </p>
      <p>
        After years of persistence, my efforts are starting to gain recognition.
        While it’s still not enough to fully support myself and my family, I remain hopeful and dedicated to my craft.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-bold mb-3 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-3">💻 My Programming Journey</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">
        I began my programming journey in <strong>2018</strong> during senior high school.
        At first, I struggled and almost gave up, but through hard work I discovered a new passion.
        Over the years, I grew to understand programming better and eventually became a web developer by the time I
        graduated from college 🎓.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        My journey into <strong>Game Development</strong> has been entirely self-taught.
        I started with <strong>Phaser.js</strong> and later discovered <strong>Godot Engine</strong>,
        which allowed me to participate in game jams and build projects with a team.
        YouTube tutorials and community resources have been my main guides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even as a beginner, I’ve always loved learning and exploring new skills.
        I look forward to more opportunities to grow, create, and contribute in the future 🚀.

      <p class="mb-3">
        After many years on this journey, I see this as a new milestone to improve my work and grow in my career.
        I dream that someday I can achieve my dream job and build the game project I am currently working on.
        Creating this website is part of my effort to rise above struggles and give new meaning to my life.
